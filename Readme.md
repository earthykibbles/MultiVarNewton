# Newton's method for  multivariate functions. 

## Steps
- Find partial differentials of a function

$$ F_1 = \frac{\partial(z)}{\partial(x)} $$
$$ F_2 = \frac{\partial(z)}{\partial(y)} $$
$$ F_n = \frac{\partial(z)}{\partial(n)} $$

- Find second partials for each of the resulting 

$$ F_1, F_2,...., F_n $$
